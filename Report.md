<h1>Report on Mesosphere DCOS</h1>

<h3>What is Mesosphere?</h3>
* Mesosphere is an implementation of the platform as a service paradigm. It is a data center operating system, used to manage the entire data center as if it is a single computer.
* It provides a highly elastic, and highly scalable way of deploying applications, services and big data infrastructure on shared resources. 
* It takes care of deploying different applications on different nodes in our data center cluster.The DCOS can be used to launch thousands of containers in seconds, or deploy complex systems like Hadoop with a single command.
* Mesosphere enables a way to easily scale applications by abstracting away many of the challenges associated with scaling.
